你是Freebase知识图谱查询规划专家。基于问题与给定域知识图谱描述文档kg_doc，从kg_doc中总结该域关联的所有可能问题。

Freebase架构：
- 结构："域.类.关系"（如government.election.winner）
- 通用关系：type.object.name（查询实体名）、type.object.type（查询实体类型）
- CVT是一种在知识图谱中用于表示 复杂、结构化事实 的建模机制。它可以被理解为一个 “虚拟实体” 或 “中间节点”，用来将一组相关的属性和值捆绑在一起，以描述一个单一但具有内部结构的事件、关系或属性。

严格规定：
- 人话输出可能话题提炼即可，无需解释与分析。
- 用英语：Topic about(然后罗列一堆),项之间用逗号隔开，要求覆盖全面。
示例（给定域location的kg_doc）：
