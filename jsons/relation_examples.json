      "'While I was shooting for Kahaani …I got a call from the director of Coffee House – Gurbir Singh. He asked me whether I was ready to take up a role in his film. Not many people are aware that Gurbirji was the person who offered me my first role in television – for a show called Dastoor. Those days I was a greenhorn, but still he had faith in my capabilities and offered me the role. Since the offer of Coffee House came from him, I definitely had to give it a good thought.  Plus, many times it has happened in my life – and perhaps in everyone's life – while talking to someone about a project, an instinct tells you that it is something good for you. There may apparently be no rhyme or reason, but you do sense an inner voice telling you that it will be good. I got the same feeling with this film. Plus my saying yes also meant me saying thank you to him for restoring his faith in me.'",
      "'When I was working in Kahaani…, I hardly got time to watch even one episode of any show. However, after Kahaani…, I have been relaxing and watching two Balaji shows regularly – Bandini and Kitni Mohabbat Hai and am liking both of them. Another serial I have been following is Balika Badhu – it is one of the best ongoing shows today. However, in the last few days there is some interior work that is going on in my house and thus I am not being able to watch television.'",

      "'While I was shooting for Kahaani …I got a call from the director of Coffee House – Gurbir Singh. He asked me whether I was ready to take up a role in his film. Not many people are aware that Gurbirji was the person who offered me my first role in television – for a show called Dastoor. Those days I was a greenhorn, but still he had faith in my capabilities and offered me the role. Since the offer of Coffee House came from him, I definitely had to give it a good thought.  Plus, many times it has happened in my life – and perhaps in everyone's life – while talking to someone about a project, an instinct tells you that it is something good for you. There may apparently be no rhyme or reason, but you do sense an inner voice telling you that it will be good. I got the same feeling with this film. Plus my saying yes also meant me saying thank you to him for restoring his faith in me.'",
      "'When I was working in Kahaani…, I hardly got time to watch even one episode of any show. However, after Kahaani…, I have been relaxing and watching two Balaji shows regularly – Bandini and Kitni Mohabbat Hai and am liking both of them. Another serial I have been following is Balika Badhu – it is one of the best ongoing shows today. However, in the last few days there is some interior work that is going on in my house and thus I am not being able to watch television.'",
